## Task 4: Currency Converter using API

Welcome to Task 4 of the Codsoft Internship! This project involves creating a Currency Converter using an external API in Java. The goal of this task is to demonstrate your ability to integrate with external APIs and perform currency conversion based on user input.

### Usage

To use the Currency Converter:

1. Run the Java program.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the base currency (e.g., USD), target currency (e.g., EUR), and the amount to convert.
3. The program will fetch the latest exchange rates from the API and perform the currency conversion.
4. It will then display the converted amount.
